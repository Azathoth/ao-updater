==========

Atlus Online (and IPBoard) seem like they're eons in the dust
compared with how a forum should function. So, I'm upgrading it
myself---with a userscript.

To run it, you'll need userscript support. Check the internet for a
way to do it in your particular browser. In Firefox, the easiest way
is to install the Scriptish extension.

Once you install it, you'll see a new ticker at the bottom of every
thread. There are three numbers. On the left is the timer. This ticks
down to 0, then attempts to update the thread. In the middle is the
total number of new posts pulled to the current page. The one on
the right is actually in a text box. Change the number and hit enter
to change the refresh timing.

I've also changed the favicon from the default IPBoard icon (favicon
courtesy of Kinky). Once the updater pulls a new message, the favicon
will change to alert you.

Script is still in beta. Don't be surprised when things don't work.
If they don't work, please do submit it as a bug on the AO thread.
Or, if you want to be really generous, fix the bug yourself, and
submit a pull request!

Enjoy.
